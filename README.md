### Hey there ðŸ‘Œ

I'm a 20 year Javascript/Typescript Fullstack developer. My github has seen a lot of activity as of late, but that's because I'm studying everyday to become better and better at what I do. It's my passion, really.
<br>
ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript and it's usage with some libraries and frameworks and I don't think I'll want to come back to vanilla Javascript so soon, cause TS is just too good to work with.
